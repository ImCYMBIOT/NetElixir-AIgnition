    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's competitive digital landscape, understanding the customer journey and optimizing ad spend across multiple channels is crucial for maximizing conversions and improving return on investment (ROI). The challenge lies in effectively analyzing large volumes of customer interaction data and ad spend metrics to identify the most impactful channels for initiating and closing conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution addresses this challenge by leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. We begin by collecting and processing customer journey data, encompassing various touchpoints such as clicks, impressions, and conversions across channels like Google, Meta, and direct traffic. Concurrently, we analyze ad spend data to gain insights into the relationship between spend, impressions, clicks, and resulting revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying machine learning models, we identify trends and patterns in channel performance at different stages of the customer journey. This enables us to determine which channels are most effective for driving conversions and where budget allocations can be optimized. Ultimately, we develop a data-driven media investment plan that reallocates budgets to maximize customer acquisition and conversion rates, ensuring optimal ad spend effectiveness.\n"

    "## Approach and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Loading**: The datasets are loaded from Google Drive, where each dataset is read from its respective CSV file. This step ensures that the data is available for analysis and modeling.\n",
    "- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the data is performed using methods like `head()` to inspect the first few rows, and `describe()` to generate summary statistics. This helps in understanding the distribution of data and identifying any potential issues such as missing values.\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**: In this step, the input data is prepared for machine learning modeling. The necessary columns are selected, and any required transformations are applied to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning Model**: A Linear Regression model is implemented to predict conversions based on input features such as `Impressions`, `Clicks`, and `Cost`.\n",
    "  - **Model Training**: The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`. The Linear Regression model is then trained on the training data to learn the relationship between features and the target variable (`Conversions`).\n",
    "  - **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict conversions on the test data. The model’s performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Budget Allocation**: The predicted conversions are used to allocate the total budget across different channels:\n",
    "  - **Minimum Budget Allocation**: A fixed minimum budget (10% of the total budget) is allocated to each channel.\n",
    "  - **Remaining Budget Distribution**: The remaining budget is distributed based on the predicted conversions for each channel. Channels with higher predicted conversions receive a larger share of the remaining budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Historical Performance as Predictor**: The model assumes that historical performance data (impressions, clicks, and cost) is indicative of future conversions.\n",
    "- **Linear Relationship**: The Linear Regression model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (`Conversions`).\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: It is assumed that the datasets are accurate and complete, with no significant outliers or missing values that could affect the model’s performance.\n",
    "- **Fixed Minimum Budget**: The assumption that a fixed minimum budget (10% of the total) is suitable for all channels, regardless of their predicted performance.\n"
